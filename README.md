# Drowsiness-detection-based-on-Pupil-movement-behaviour
A real-time drowsiness detection system based on pupil movement and behavior. It tracks blink rate, gaze direction, and fixation patterns using computer vision and machine learning. When fatigue is detected, alerts are triggered, making it useful for drivers, workplace safety, and healthcare monitoring.
